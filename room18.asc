They quickly decided to set up a defensible base and began to explore the area more thoroughly.

In the process, they discovered a passageway going back into the bowels of the mountains.");

Large, heavily muscled, and powerfully built, the Formori were easily a match for two Reman legionaries. Fortunately, they were also none too bright, so the limited number of troops were able to force the lumbering behemoths out without too much difficulty.");

The Formori who inhabited the region were suffering from diseases and an all-abiding depression. In their weakened state, they were little trouble for the new conquerors.");
